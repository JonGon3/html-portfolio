<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Jonathan Ramirez, a young man with a deep passion for faith, learning, and growth. My journey in life has been shaped by a strong sense of curiosity and determination, leading me from being a nondenominational Protestant to embracing Catholicism. I’ve always been drawn to theology and philosophy, appreciating how they connect to the broader questions of life and purpose. I’m committed to practicing my faith freely and living it out in every aspect of my life. Currently, I’m preparing to be confirmed in the Church, which is an important milestone in my spiritual journey..</p>

<p>Outside of my faith, I’m driven to build a meaningful career that aligns with my values and allows me to make a lasting impact. After graduating high school, I started college and have been exploring different paths, from carpentry and IT to the Coast Guard. I love the idea of finding a career that offers flexibility, stability, and opportunities for growth, whether it’s through the trades, technology, or the military. Whatever I pursue, I want it to be something I can excel at, provide for my future family, and create a life of independence.</p>

<p>Fitness and discipline are also essential to me. I enjoy martial arts, going to the gym, and pushing myself physically and mentally. I believe that maintaining strength and focus in the body reflects discipline in the soul. I dream of one day investing in real estate, using the skills I’ve learned to build wealth and stability while helping others. I’m always looking for opportunities to grow, and I believe that with hard work, faith, and perseverance, I can achieve great things..</p>
